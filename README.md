# TPC-H Query Workload

## Customized for Distinct Cardinality Estimation
A custom TPC-H query workload with a set of 58 multi-dataset (i.e., join) queries over the standard TPC-H schema. This workload is designed to evaluate distinct cardinality estimation for multiple attributes in join queries. Each query contains a GROUP BY clause.
